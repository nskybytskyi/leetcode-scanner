ai-generated scripts to setup a github repository for your leetcode submissions

I wanted to share my solutions to LeetCode problems with the community and created a GitHub repository to host them. However, I've been leetcoding for almost five years and accumulated a few submissions, so I had to automate the commitment of my submissions to this repository. The repo with actual submissions is private, but I felt comfortable sharing the automation scripts I used already.

Some instructions for running it:
1. grab a session cookie from leetcode and put it into an environment variable
2. initialize a git repository and set its remote
3. run main.py

## Credits  
This project was developed with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), which assisted in designing and refining the scripts.
